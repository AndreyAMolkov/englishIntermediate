I'd like to notice that there are two main ways of spending free time: the one is to do some physical activities (often outdoors), for example, football, swimming, hockey, skiing; and another way is to enjoy something relaxing at home or in special places: reading, watching TV. 
At any rate, hobby is a matter of taste, and everybody should choose it according to the personal preferences.

As for me, I like to pass my leisure time both in active and passive way. I really enjoy reading or watching films, because it's always interesting, helpful and helps to relax, what is especially necessary after a long tiring day. 
Also I am fond of active sportsin my time it is djogging,when it is possible. 
Sometimes I feel that I need to escape from everyday worries and to do something no thought-provoking. 
In many cases I can't let me doing anything very extraordinary, so I just go walking over long distances. 
It really helps to release the tension and refresh the mind.
