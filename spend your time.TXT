Every day I wake up at 6-30.
Then I have breakfast and take a shower.
Every morning I do a few house work and look after my eldest son.
I drive son to school and my wife  and to her work.
The whole journey takes about 40 minutes, and I spend this time learning English, for example, listening to a book or learning something.
I work about 9 hours a day. At 6:00 I go home and have super.
When we have supper, we talk, and after that needs time check the homework of the eldest son.
I do not commit in this process, I am only responsible for English, usually this is Tuesday and the weekend, and I learn short verses with the younger ones.
We can also play soccer or something else, read or watch TV, or just chat.
At 10 we go to bed.
