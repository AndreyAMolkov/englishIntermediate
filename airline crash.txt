Josh Peltz was on US Airways Flight 1549, which crash-landed in the Hudson River in New York in January 2009.
He had been in seat10 next to the emergency exit. 
A few minutes after take-off there had been a loud explosion. 
Everybody had gasped and there had been a few screams. 
Then, surprisingly, it had gone very quiet – everyone had been assessing the situation. 
It soon became obvious they had not been going back to LaGuardia Airport, they had been heading for the water. 
I had started thinking this had been it. 
He had thought about his wife, Tesa, and their two children. 
Then He had heard the announcement,  “This is the Capitan, brace for impact”, and everything suddenly had got very clear. 
He had had to stop thinking about death and started thinking about what He had been going to do once the pilot had landed in the water. 
“You sat in this seat,” He had thought, “you had got to get this door open”
