Nizhny Novgorod. The first thing you will notice when you come to this city is a beautiful view of the confluence of two rivers - the Oka and the Volga. 
For more than forty years, foreigners could not officially get into this city - motor ships with foreign tourists passed at night and without stops. 
Only in the early 1990s Gorky again became Nizhny Novgorod and it was opened to foreign guests.
The urban landscape of Nizhny Novgorod is very interesting. 
A comparison with a layer cake comes to mind. 
Here is a merchant's wooden building, characteristic two-story houses, carved platbands. 
The whole streets of antiquity have survived! In places, gilded domes of churches glisten. 
One of the most significant is considered to be the Cathedral of Alexander Nevsky. 
And in the city you can walk. Many locations where it is pleasant to walk on a warm summer evening. 
The pedestrian street Bolshaya Pokrovskaya is especially fond of Nizhny Novgorod residents. 
On the street itself there are a lot of people, a large number of restaurants, cafes, bars and other places for leisure of a modern city dweller.

If you slightly deviate from the usual route and look into the gateway, then you can find an unusual example of Soviet architecture - the commune house, which received the pathos called "Cultural Revolution". 
Buildings in the style of constructivism are connected by suspended walkways.

An interesting idea: architects felt that Soviet citizens would not be burdened by everyday life. 
Therefore, the apartments did not have kitchens - but downstairs was the dining room. But suddenly something went wrong ... 
As Nizhny Novgorod told us, now there are still apartments that are in demand on the real estate market.
