Venice.
We arrived in Venice about midday on Friday. I is a nice old city. The only way to get around Venice is to walk. It is the best city in the world for couples. The first place we went to was Piazza San Marco. It was pretty. We ate an ice cream. Then we walked along the Grand Canal and saw the Bridge of Sighs. It is nice but busy/ In the evening we had a meal in a restaurant and then we went to bed.

Escape from Alcatraz.
We arrived in San Francisco on Tuesday afternoon. The first thing I noticed was how beautiful and cosmopolitan it is here. In the 1960s it was home to the hippy movement, but nowadays it is home to a lot of internet companies like Twitter. Because of this, some parts of San Francisco are very smart and expensive while other parts are a bit more old –fashioned and arty. Landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge are world-famous, but seeing them for real is quite special. However, our hotel is not special at all. We’ve got a tiny, dirty room and the beds are awful. I had a very restless night.
On Wednesday morning, we took a boat to Alcatraz, the famous prison on an island in San Francisco Bay. It closed in 1963 and these days it is a popular tourist attraction. Jenifer was feeling a bit seasick by the time we arrived, but it was worth the trio. The island is small and rocky. You can hear the seagull and smell the sea air even in the prison. The prison itself is like a huge factory. I would hate to be in prison there, but Jenifer thought that it was nicer than our hotel.
