Landon is from Australia. He’s 24 and he’s studying archaeology at university. Landon wants a holiday with lots of local history and culture … and a few sandy beaches to relax. He hates crowds and noise.
Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
It sounds like a lot of travelling. But there’s so much to see. Fly into Bangkok and spend a few days visiting the beautiful floating markets. The old City and, of course, the Grand Palace – the historic heart of Thailand. With its temples, halls and extraordinary architecture, it is a must-see.
Then travel overland to Angkor Wat in Cambodia.
Angkor Wat is a huge temple complex which contains the largest religious building in the world. About 500 years ago, Angkor Wat was mysteriously abandoned and only rediscovered 150 years ago.
After that, fly to Halong Bay in the north of Vietnam. Thousands of tiny islands seem to float in the blue waters of the bay. Some people call in the Eighth Wonder of the World. There’s certainly nowhere quite like it.
Avoid.
The party islands like Koh Samui. With their full moon parties these are great for some people, but not for people like you who hate noise.
