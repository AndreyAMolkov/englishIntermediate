Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
It sounds like a lot of travelling. But there’s so much to see. Fly into Bangkok and spend a few days visiting the beautiful floating markets. The old City and, of course, the Grand Palace – the historic heart of Thailand. With its temples, halls and extraordinary architecture, it is a must-see.
Then travel overland to Angkor Wat in Cambodia.
Angkor Wat is a huge temple complex which contains the largest religious building in the world. About 500 years ago, Angkor Wat was mysteriously abandoned and only rediscovered 150 years ago.
After that, fly to Halong Bay in the north of Vietnam. Thousands of tiny islands seem to float in the blue waters of the bay. Some people call in the Eighth Wonder of the World. There’s certainly nowhere quite like it.
Avoid.
The party islands like Koh Samui. With their full moon parties these are great for some people, but not for people like you who hate noise.





Valentina is from Chile. She’s 27 years old and she loves shopping and sun. She wants to go somewhere special in January or February.
Dubai.
It’s one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, and it is also one of the best for shopping. What other city has an annual shopping festival? It is a long flight for Valentina, over 17 hours from Santiago, but if  she has a couple of weeks to spare, she’ll find that cosmopolitan Dubai is right up her street.
The weather makes it too hot to walk outside for much of the year (though it should be fine in January) so shopping malls are one way to escape the heat. Dubai Mall, for example, has over 12000 shops – more that some small cities. And just like small cities, some of its malls have theatres, art galleries and even indoor ski slopes.
If all this seems a bit too artificial, Valentina could try the Dubai “souks”, which are a kind of traditional market. They aren’t quite as beautiful as the bazaars in Turkey and Morocco but they’re worth visiting anyway. It’s where the locals go and it’s a good place to learn to haggle and pick up some bargains!
Avoid most of Europe. Cities like Edinburgh, London, Paris and Berlin are great for shopping, but there’s not much chance of seeing the sun in January or February!

Valentina is from Chile. She’s 27 years old and she loves shopping and sun. She wants to go somewhere special in January or February.
Dubai.
It’s one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, and it is also one of the best for shopping. What other city has an annual shopping festival? It is a long flight for Valentina, over 17 hours from Santiago, but if  she has a couple of weeks to spare, she’ll find that cosmopolitan Dubai is right up her street.
The weather makes it too hot to walk outside for much of the year (though it should be fine in January) so shopping malls are one way to escape the heat. Dubai Mall, for example, has over 12000 shops – more that some small cities. And just like small cities, some of its malls have theatres, art galleries and even indoor ski slopes.
If all this seems a bit too artificial, Valentina could try the Dubai “souks”, which are a kind of traditional market. They aren’t quite as beautiful as the bazaars in Turkey and Morocco but they’re worth visiting anyway. It’s where the locals go and it’s a good place to learn to haggle and pick up some bargains!
Avoid most of Europe. Cities like Edinburgh, London, Paris and Berlin are great for shopping, but there’s not much chance of seeing the sun in January or February!

Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
It sounds like a lot of travelling. But there’s so much to see. Fly into Bangkok and spend a few days visiting the beautiful floating markets. The old City and, of course, the Grand Palace – the historic heart of Thailand. With its temples, halls and extraordinary architecture, it is a must-see.
Then travel overland to Angkor Wat in Cambodia.
Angkor Wat is a huge temple complex which contains the largest religious building in the world. About 500 years ago, Angkor Wat was mysteriously abandoned and only rediscovered 150 years ago.
After that, fly to Halong Bay in the north of Vietnam. Thousands of tiny islands seem to float in the blue waters of the bay. Some people call in the Eighth Wonder of the World. There’s certainly nowhere quite like it.

It’s one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, and it is also one of the best for shopping. What other city has an annual shopping festival? It is a long flight for Valentina, over 17 hours from Santiago, but if  she has a couple of weeks to spare, she’ll find that cosmopolitan Dubai is right up her street.
The weather makes it too hot to walk outside for much of the year (though it should be fine in January) so shopping malls are one way to escape the heat. Dubai Mall, for example, has over 12000 shops – more that some small cities. And just like small cities, some of its malls have theatres, art galleries and even indoor ski slopes.
If all this seems a bit too artificial, Valentina could try the Dubai “souks”, which are a kind of traditional market. They aren’t quite as beautiful as the bazaars in Turkey and Morocco but they’re worth visiting anyway. It’s where the locals go and it’s a good place to learn to haggle and pick up some bargains!
Avoid most of Europe. Cities like Edinburgh, London, Paris and Berlin are great for shopping, but there’s not much chance of seeing the sun in January or February!

Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
It sounds like a lot of travelling. But there’s so much to see. Fly into Bangkok and spend a few days visiting the beautiful floating markets. The old City and, of course, the Grand Palace – the historic heart of Thailand. With its temples, halls and extraordinary architecture, it is a must-see.
Then travel overland to Angkor Wat in Cambodia.
Angkor Wat is a huge temple complex which contains the largest religious building in the world. About 500 years ago, Angkor Wat was mysteriously abandoned and only rediscovered 150 years ago.
After that, fly to Halong Bay in the north of Vietnam. Thousands of tiny islands seem to float in the blue waters of the bay. Some people call in the Eighth Wonder of the World. There’s certainly nowhere quite like it.
Avoid.
The party islands like Koh Samui. With their full moon parties these are great for some people, but not for people like you who hate noise.

Landon is from Australia. He’s 24 and he’s studying archaeology at university. Landon wants a holiday with lots of local history and culture … and a few sandy beaches to relax. He hates crowds and noise.
Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
It sounds like a lot of travelling. But there’s so much to see. Fly into Bangkok and spend a few days visiting the beautiful floating markets. The old City and, of course, the Grand Palace – the historic heart of Thailand. With its temples, halls and extraordinary architecture, it is a must-see.
Then travel overland to Angkor Wat in Cambodia.
Angkor Wat is a huge temple complex which contains the largest religious building in the world. About 500 years ago, Angkor Wat was mysteriously abandoned and only rediscovered 150 years ago.
After that, fly to Halong Bay in the north of Vietnam. Thousands of tiny islands seem to float in the blue waters of the bay. Some people call in the Eighth Wonder of the World. There’s certainly nowhere quite like it.
Avoid.
The party islands like Koh Samui. With their full moon parties these are great for some people, but not for people like you who hate noise.
