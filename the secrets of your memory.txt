Why Can I remember events in my childhood but not what happened last week?
We remember the things that have strong connections in your mind, especially emotional connections. Childhood memories are often very emotional: we experience things for the first time so we have strong feelings of fear or excitement. Retelling events also helps to fix them in our memories and interesting or funny stories from our childhood are often told again and again.
Do some people really have a photographic memory?
It is well know that some people have an extraordinary memory. Daniel Tammet , for example, can remember the first 22500 digits of pi and Stephen Wiltdhire can draw a detailed picture of a city from memory after flying over it in  a helicopter. However neither Daniel nor Stephen have  a photographic memory. They are good at remembering particular things for a limited time. A person with a photographic memory could remember every detail of a picture, a book or an event many years later. No one has yet proved that they have a photographic memory in scientific test.
I computer memory better than human memory?
That depends what you mean by “better”. Information in a computer is stored in separate pieces. Human memory is stored in a different way. Each piece of information is connected of many other pieces. That’s why a particular smell can bring back memories of a holiday or a person. The problem with human memory is that it is messy and not very accurate. The problem with computer memory is that it can not make connections between pieces of information – it is not creative.
I am 24. Is my memory getting worse?
Not yet, but it will do soon. Our memory reaches its full power at the age 25. At that point, we can remember up to 200 pieces of information a second. After this age, however, the brain start to get smaller. By the age 40, we are losing 10000 brain cells every day. By middle age, our memory is significantly worse than when we were young.
Is it possible to remember early childhood?
Scientist used to believe that is was impossible to remember very early childhood, but recent research shows that babies are much clever than we previously thought. Some people really can remember being a baby. Others, however, remember nothing before the age five or even ten.

Childhood memories are often very emotional: we experience things for the first time so we have strong feelings of fear or excitement. Retelling events also helps to fix them in our memories and interesting or funny stories from our childhood are often told again and again.
Do some people really have a photographic memory?
It is well know that some people have an extraordinary memory. Daniel Tammet , for example, can remember the first 22500 digits of pi and Stephen Wiltdhire can draw a detailed picture of a city from memory after flying over it in  a helicopter. However neither Daniel nor Stephen have  a photographic memory. They are good at remembering particular things for a limited time. A person with a photographic memory could remember every detail of a picture, a book or an event many years later. No one has yet proved that they have a photographic memory in scientific test.
I computer memory better than human memory?
That depends what you mean by “better”. Information in a computer is stored in separate pieces. Human memory is stored in a different way. Each piece of information is connected of many other pieces. That’s why a particular smell can bring back memories of a holiday or a person. The problem with human memory is that it is messy and not very accurate. The problem with computer memory is that it can not make connections between pieces of information – it is not creative.
I am 24. Is my memory getting worse?
Not yet, but it will do soon. Our memory reaches its full power at the age 25. At that point, we can remember up to 200 pieces of information a second. After this age, however, the brain start to get smaller. By the age 40, we are losing 10000 brain cells every day. By middle age, our memory is significantly worse than when we were young.
Is it possible to remember early childhood?
Scientist used to believe that is was impossible to remember very early childhood, but recent research shows that babies are much clever than we previously thought. Some people really can remember being a baby. Others, however, remember nothing before the age five or even ten.
















Why Can I remember events in my childhood but not what happened last week?
We remember the things that have strong connections in your mind, especially emotional connections.
