Vladimir Mashkov was born on November 27, 1963, in the city of Novokuznetsk (USSR (Russia)), in the family of an actor (Russian) and a director (Italian) of a puppet theater.

He has been lived in Novokuznetsk for several years, where he moved with his family in the mid-sixties. 
He moved to Novosibirsk in the late seventies. 
Arriving in Novosibirsk, he entered the University at the Faculty of Biology, but after realizing a year later that biology was not his calling, he entered the Novosibirsk Theater School. 
He has moved to Moscow since 1984. Where he was studying in луюр. 
He has many roles in Russia and abroad. 
I have noticed him since 2007 when he was released film "Elimination". 
I remember that I was watching this serial a few times. Where he was playing the main role. 
Then was released "Piranha Hunt". it is an action film.
I believe that this actor should be nominated as one of the best actors on first plane.
