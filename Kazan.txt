We arrived in Kazan on a Friday night. 
The first thing I noticed was narrow roads in the city itself and a large number of cameras on the roads. 
Kazan is a beautiful city with unusual shapes for me. 
Although here, as well as in our city, there is the Kremlin and the main pedestrian street.
We always stay with relatives when we come to Kazan. 
And this time it was no exception.
The next day we went for a walk and wander around the shops, because this is my wife who loves all sorts of new and unusual things that may differ from the assortment of our city. 
For example, once we saw a beautiful carpet and bought it there. The next day, we usually walk around the city on foot, go to cafes and order national sweets and desserts. 
This is great, although we understand that we can buy the same thing in our city.
In general, it is a beautiful city, but the width of the roads just upsets me and also a large number of lanes for public transport.
