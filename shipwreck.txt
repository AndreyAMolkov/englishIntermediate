Thomas Sheridan is a retired professor at MIT in Boston, USA. 
He was shipwrecked on a boat tour of the Galapagos Island in 1998.
One warm, clear evening on the upper deck watching the sunset when he noticed that the boat was moving one way than other. 
At first, it did not worry them, but as the boat began rocking violently, his wife and He had to hold on for dear life.
 Suddenly the boat rolled to the right, paused, and then rolled into the ocean. 
A wall of water came at them. 
There was just no way that they could hold on.
They all went over the side into the water. 
He tried to come up, He struck his head and went down again. 
When he managed to get to the surface, his first thought was that he had to find his wife. 
It was almost dark and He could not see her. 
But He heard her calling him.
He told his wife not to go near the boat as it might pull them down. 
The water, thankfully, was not very cold. 
They found a life belt, which they held onto until they came across a rubber dinghy holding five passengers.
 It was dark at that moment. 
After two hours they found the ship's crew in a larger dinghy, and they all got into it. 
They found a few flares and when they saw lights on the horizon, they tried two of the flares, but they did not work. 
Eventually, another distant ship passed and they used them last flares, which worked. 
A searchlight blinked back at them. 
It was a fantastic moment - people finally knew they were there.
Looking back, He felt like it did not really happen to him.
 It is more like a kind of movie, but He has a tremendous feeling of doos fortune.
