I want to talk about the main pedestrian street of our city. 
This is Bolshaya Pokrovskaya street. 
Here are two very similar photographs of one street, but one photograph of the 19th century, and the second is modern. 
We see that the historical buildings are the same as they were. 
But before there was a street with trams and horses, and now it’s only a pedestrian. 
I also think that the street was not as busy as it is now. 
And people's clothes were less colorful than now. 
I am sure that when evening comes, we can see a lot of LED signs and bright and colorful expositions. 
More recently, statues were specially installed in old-fashioned clothes of the 19th century and not only.
