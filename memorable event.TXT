My most memorable event in the past is a trip to Turkey. 
Where we got unforgettable memories. It was our honeymoon with my wife about 10 years ago. 
We have a great wedding and we decided to go to Turkey. We bought tickets and flew. 
We had a great time in Turkey - visited some sights, swam in the sea and took many photos. 
But the most interesting thing began with the fact that we bought a tour for a trip on a catamaran, then we had to fish and have dinner at the lake. 
When we went fishing, something went wrong, and the catamaran began to sink from overload. 
There were too many people. 
Then we were very scared. 
But now these are funny memories for us.
