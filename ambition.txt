Ambition is like a call. 
An innate sense of who and what I am or intend to be. 
What I desire or imagine becoming is vital to my sense of purpose and identity. 
So I donâ€™t work on changing my ambition but I can improve my ability to achieve those ambitions.

I now have several goals: personal and professional.
As an engineer, I want to develop my Java programmer skills. 
I need to learn more and strengthen my knowledge and ability to develop applications that work on the network. 
Get acquainted with the architecture of microservices and create several evaluation applications.
Personal goals are connected with my family - this is, first of all, raising children, education and preparing for adulthood.
