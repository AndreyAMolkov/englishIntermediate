10 years ago, I met former employer or partner Alex.
I was ready to close my business and was in search of work with similar functionality.
Alexey was looking for a person who would be ready to head the retail department and give a new impetus to the development and cooperation with mobile operators. 
I don’t remember any features of Alexey.
At our meeting, we talked about my experience and methods for solving some problems.
During our conversation, Alex was just dressed - pants and some kind of sweater. I do not remember exactly.
At the meeting, he was with a partner in another area of ??his business.
After our meeting, I was sure that we had agreed on everything and that I could fulfill the conditions of mobile operators.
After a couple of days, I began to analyze and research the current state of affairs in my new department.
