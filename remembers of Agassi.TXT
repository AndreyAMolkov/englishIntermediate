I am seven years old. I am talking to myself, because I am scares and because I am the only person who listens me.  Under my breath I whisper: just quit, Andre, just give up. Put down your racket and walk off this court right now. Go into the house and get something good to eat … Wouldn’t that feel like heaven, Andre? To just quit? To never play tennis again?
But I can’t. Not only would my father chase me round the house with my racket but something deep inside me won’t me.
I hate tennis; hate it with all my heart, but still I keep playing, keep hitting all morning and all afternoon because I have no choice.
At the moment my hatred for tennis is focused on the dragon, a ball machine modified by my father. The dragon looks, at first glance, like the ball machine in every tennis club in America, but to me it’s actually a living, breathing creature straight out of my comic books. The dragon has a brain, a will, a black heart and a horrifying voice. As the ball rises slowly to its mouth. ... the  dragon gives a terrifying roar then fires a ball at me at 170 km an hour. … I flinch every time.
My father has deliberately made the dragon fearsome… At seven years old, I’m small for my age. … My father wants the balls that shoot from the dragon’s mouth to land at my feet as if dropped from an aero plane. The way the balls bounce makes them impossible to return in the normal way. ….
Hit earlier, my father yells. Damn it Andre hit earlier. My father yells everything twice, sometimes three times, sometimes ten. Harder, he shouts, harder. But what’s the use? No matter how hard I hit a ball, no matter how early, the ball comes back. Every ball I send across the net joins the thousands that already cover the court.
My father says if I hit 2500 balls each day, I’ll hit 17500 each week and at the and of one year I’ll hit nearly one million balls. He believes in math. Numbers, he says, don’t lie, A child who hits one million balls each year will be unbeatable.
He’s yelling directly in my ear. It’s not enough to hit everything the dragon fires at me; my father wants me to hit it harder and faster than the dragon. He wants me to beat the dragon. The thought makes me panicky. I tell myself: you can’t beat the dragon. How can you beat something that never stops?  The dragon is a lot like my father. Except my father is worse.  At least the dragon stands in front of me, where I can see it. My father stays behind me. I rarely see him; only hear him day and night, yelling in my ear.
